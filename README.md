## The problem

At work, we have hundreds of XML scripts used to control an instrument. In order to understand how that instrument works inside out, in detail, I should go through every XML and understand its functions. The good thing, is that these XMLs are well commented, so I could just read the comments and more rarely read the code. But it is very time consuming because I need to remember which XMLs I have already read and also make notes in excel. 

## The task 
I would like to build a tool which locates every xml in a directory and collects some details such as title and date and then collates the comments of that xml and outputs a csv file with all information in the right order
